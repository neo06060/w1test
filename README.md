# Overview

By learning how to do webpages I am acomplishing more learning of the code language allowing me to later do better webpages.

This software is a webpage with an image and text that promptly say hello world!

My software is testing my ability to do a webpage that shows some text and image.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a one minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code.}

# Development Environment
To develop this software, I used the following tools:

Visual Studio Code as the text editor and IDE
A modern web browser (e.g., Chrome or Firefox) for testing
A basic file structure including helloworld.html, styles.css, and prompt.js

The programming languages used in this project include:

HTML for structuring the webpage
CSS for styling, including adding a full-screen background image
JavaScript for handling dynamic content (e.g., updating the greeting)

# Useful Websites

I did not use any website to do this activity, I did all the code.
